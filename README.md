# Designing-a-Small-Standard-Cell-Library
This project was created as part of the Digital Design II course in Spring 2021.
In this project, a Small Standard Cell Library was designed through creating and simulating the schematic and layout of few CMOS standard cells using the Electric VLSI and LTSpice software.
